# Final Project Parameters

## Tutorial Document

1. Must provide working installation instructions
2. Must provide working instructions to download tutorial document
3. Must document three functions in package
4. Package must contain data required to make the tutorial run
5. Tutorial should be on your package website so everyone can access it

These five points are worth 75% of the grade

## During the presentation period (Thursday, December 3, 12:30 p.m. - 2:30 p.m. )

1. When presenting your tutorial:
  - Present the rationale for why the functions you wrote are needed
  - Present the three functions
  - Viewers should be able to follow along with the code through the document
2. Ask questions of other's presentations (i.e., be an engaged audience member)

These two points are worth the final 25%. 

I'm not going to push a time limit on presentations. They should be sufficient to work through your code.
