# Everybody

## Part One

Part One of project three will be to write two functions. One must be to query and/or process data, one must be to visualize data.

Each function must be in its own .R script, and have documentation (@param, @return if appropriate, description of the function and inputs)

Each function should have a pre- and/or post-condition.

## Part Two

Push the package to GitHub and email me the link

## Part Three

Package should install with 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

devtools::install_github("yourUsername/PackageName")

```

There's no extra stuff on this one. Since you're working with your own data, make sure I have a copy of the dataset you're using.
