By Wednesday, Sept. 30, document one function we've used in class for 3 bonus points.

Put your function on this table:

|---------------|-----------------|---------|----------|
| sum     | Base R    | Sum a range of numbers | sum(1:6) | 
| mean    | Base R    | Average a vector of numbers | mean(c(1,2,3)) | 
| select  | dplyr     | selects variables in a data frame (pulls full columns) | select(sirens, Specific_Epithet)
| View    | Base R    | Pulls up spreadsheet like data in file window| View("filename")|
