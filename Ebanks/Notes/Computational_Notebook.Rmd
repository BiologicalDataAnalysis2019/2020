## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Trying revision management for the first time. 

-{x} First push worked

## Ppt Notes:
Adding code to a repository 
  - add -> commit -> push
    - Adding tells Git what file we've added stuff to 
    - Commit tells Git to save the file
      - "Commiting" to the work you've done
    - Push puts the code in the online repository

Linear model intro

```{r}

ggplot(crabs, aes(x = carapace_length, y = body_depth, color = carapace_width)) + geom_point(size = 2) + labs(x = "Carapace length (mm)", y = "Body depth (mm)", color = "Carapace width (mm)") + scale_color_distiller(palette = "Reds") + annotate("text", x = 25, y = 30, label = "R^2 = 0.977", size = 5) + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + theme_bw()

## This is nice for the distiller function

```





```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
