<p>This week, we will be starting with geospatial data and mapping. Today, we will begin with locality data in GBIF. GBIF is a website for aggregating location data from other sources.</p>
<p>We will work with two packages today. One is <a href="https://www.gbif.org/tool/81747/rgbif">RGBIF</a>, an interface to <a href="https://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a> data maintained by the <a href="https://ropensci.org/">ROpenSci</a> group.</p>

<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html">install.packages</a></span>(<span class="st">"leaflet"</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>Later in this lesson, we will also use the <code>rotl</code> package we’ve seen last week.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span>(<span class="no">tidyverse</span>)</pre></body></html></div>

<p>First, we’re going to try an example for one ant. We will query locality data and map it in a few ways. Then, you will figure out how to make the process of mapping data iterable over a set of taxa.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/reference/name_suggest.html">name_suggest</a></span>(<span class="st">"Atta mexicana"</span>)</pre></body></html></div>

##     &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;  
## 1 5035745 Atta mexicana SPECIES</code></pre>
<p>Next, we’re going to use <code>occ_search</code> to search the GBIF database for where these things are occurring.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><html><body><pre class="r"> <span class="no">occurences</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/reference/occ_search.html">occ_search</a></span>(<span class="kw">taxonKey</span> <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="fl">5035745</span>, <span class="kw">limit</span> <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="fl">20</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>Next, we will filter the resultant dataset to name and lat and longitude data.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">no_na</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="no">occurences</span>$<span class="no">data</span> <span class="kw">%&gt;%</span>

<p>And finally, we will plot the data using <code>leaflet</code></p>

That’s because leaflet is based on the same principles. We establish a canvas and the data in the first line, then we add tiles (the actual map we will use), and then we add our points. When we think about it, this is quite similar to establishing a ggplot canvas, the axes, and the points to plot.</p>
<p>One point is easy. How often do we only want one point, though? Probably, we will want to plot several species. First, with a partner, work out how to get GBIF ids for a set of taxa.</p>

<p>We will need one package we haven’t used yet, Liam Revell’s Phytools.</p>

<pre><code>## Skipping install of 'phytools' from a github remote, the SHA1 (7b375aa7) has not changed since last install.

<div class="sourceCode" id="cb45"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span>(<span class="no">phytools</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## Loading required package: ape</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Loading required package: maps</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Attaching package: 'maps'</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The following object is masked from 'package:purrr':

##     map</code></pre>
<p>Plotting a phylogeny to a map is a fairly simple task, but has a lot of data preparation work involved. The basic steps look like this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Synchronize names between GBIF and OpenTree</li>
<li>Format GBIF data into a matrix</li>
<li>Add branch lengths to our tree</li>
<li>Plot</li>
</ol>
<p>You may have noticed that the GBIF package includes citation information in the scientificName column. We will need to remove that. To do this, let’s try the <code>strsplit</code> function. This function splits a character string on a defined character and returns a vector of the elements in that character string.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb50"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">my_string</span> <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="st">"This is my string"</span>
<span class="no">split_up</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/strsplit.html">strsplit</a></span>(<span class="no">my_string</span>, <span class="st">" "</span>)
<span class="no">split_up</span></pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [1] "This"   "is"     "my"     "string"</code></pre>
<p>Try indexing this object. What do you need to do to access data? Now, with a partner, make this iterable across every row in the <code>scientificName</code> column. Then, unite the split objects into one new column called <code>genusSpecies</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb52"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">split_names</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="no">mega_df</span> <span class="kw">%&gt;%</span>

<p>If you look at the data, there are some obviously mistaken values in there. For example, BOLD is not an ant species. Let’s drop that.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb53"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="co"># Use ROTL to resolve names</span>

<span class="no">no_bold</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="no">split_names</span>[ <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/grep.html">grep</a></span>(<span class="st">"BOLD"</span>, <span class="no">split_names</span>$<span class="no">genusSpecies</span>, <span class="kw">invert</span> <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="fl">TRUE</span>) , ]</pre></body></html></div>
<p>We also ended up with far more ant taxa than I thought. What a nice problem to have! But let’s filter down to, say, five of them:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb54"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">a_couple_ants</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span>(<span class="st">"Martialis_heureka"</span>, <span class="st">"Atta_mexicana"</span>, <span class="st">"Atta_cephalotes"</span>, <span class="st">"Atta_sexdens"</span>, <span class="st">"Atta_vollenweideri"</span>)
<span class="no">subset_data</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="no">no_bold</span> <span class="kw">%&gt;%</span>
    <span class="fu"><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html">filter</a></span>(<span class="no">genusSpecies</span> <span class="kw">%in%</span> <span class="no">a_couple_ants</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>Now, let’s use ROTL to make sure we don’t have spelling errors.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb55"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">reconciled_names</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="kw pkg">rotl</span><span class="kw ns">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/rotl/reference/tnrs_match_names.html">tnrs_match_names</a></span>(<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/unique.html">unique</a></span>(<span class="no">subset_data</span>$<span class="no">genusSpecies</span>))</pre></body></html></div>
<p>You’ll notice that a couple of the taxa have undergone taxonomic revision. We can replace the out of date names like so:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb56"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">subset_data</span>$<span class="no">genusSpecies</span>[<span class="no">subset_data</span>$<span class="no">genusSpecies</span> <span class="kw">==</span> <span class="st">"Atta_colombica"</span>] <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="st">"Atta_columbica"</span>
<span class="no">subset_data</span>$<span class="no">genusSpecies</span>[<span class="no">subset_data</span>$<span class="no">genusSpecies</span> <span class="kw">==</span> <span class="st">"Atta_mexicana"</span>] <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="st">"Atya_scabra"</span></pre></body></html></div>
<p>This isn’t crucial right now, but later in the lesson a mismatch of tip labels and GBIF coordinates will be fatal.</p>
<p>Now, we will query our tree from OpenTree.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb57"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">tree</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="kw pkg">rotl</span><span class="kw ns">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/rotl/reference/tol_induced_subtree.html">tol_induced_subtree</a></span>(<span class="no">reconciled_names</span>$<span class="no">ott_id</span>, <span class="kw">label</span><span class="kw">=</span><span class="st">"name"</span>)</pre></body></html></div>

<p>Now, we must combine our GBIF data and our taxon names into a matrix, a two-dimensional data structure with fewer neat data parsing features than a dataframe or tibble. These structures are often preferred when speed is an issue. Matrices can only be one type, which means we must add the row names after generating the object.</p>

<p>First, let’s resolve the polytomy issue. We will do this using Ape’s <code>multi2di</code> function, which arbitrarily resolves polytomies. In real life, you would probably want to think about this a little more.:</p>

<p>We’ll also need to add some branch lengths. In our case, we will draw them from an exponential distribution. The exponential is often assumed to be a reasonable approximation for banch lengths - you’ll hear more about this if you take my systematics lab ;)</p>
<p>In our case, we will use <code>rexp</code> to make the draws, and we will map them to a new attribute <code>edge.length</code> that is a standard attribute of the tree object. In reality, you would likely not want to do this for a publication quality analysis, and would want to estimate branch lengths from data. But being able to rescale branch lengths is a good skill for sensitivity and other similar analyses.</p>
