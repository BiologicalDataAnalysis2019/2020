Error: Can't extract columns that don't exist.
x Column `key` doesn't exist.
Run `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred.

I Cant get the data from the orginal class to be able to merge for the new class/ I cant actaully do the lesson for this due to not being able to get the data but Ive watched the videos like 4 times

also How do I pull the data/download the data for USW00003145. Upload it to your data directory. from that specific item. 
Would I just download.file(link and destile), read.csv then use ncdc_locs?? maybe download.file("") write.csv???

To merge I would_ 
merge(by old data by new data) or would it be merge(by.old data by.new data)

to drop rows, filter
calc_f %>%
  filter(tmin  ) %>%
  filter(tmax )
  or could you use data[complete.cases(data)]


plotting merge data:
ggplot(mereged data, mapping = aes(x = tmin, y = hindfoot_length)) + geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.1, color = sex)) + facet_grid(cols  = vars(species_id)) + geom_smooth(aes(group=sex), method='lm')
