Today, we're going to do something a little different than we have been doing.

In the first project, we asked about mammal body sizes and climate change. First, I'd like you to google Bergman's Rule.
Develop a hypothesis of what you'd expect under Bergman's rule on a warming planet:

```

```

To test your hypothesis, are the data that you have sufficient? What other data do you want?

```
#Answer here
```

Sketch on one of the whiteboards (as a graph) what you think the relationship between the data you wish you had and one of the variables in our data might be.
